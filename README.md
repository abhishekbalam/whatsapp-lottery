# A multipurpose lottery service for selecting winners from Whatsapp Lists


I made this to make quick lottery based descisions in my class whatsapp group.

Example Input:

```
Pls enter your names:
0) John Doe
1) Jane Doe
2) Jane Smith
3) John Smith
```

Returns a list of winners defined by the `max` variable in the code.
